# Predict_Diabetes_Using_ML
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting diabetes using a real-world dataset. It involves end-to-end steps including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, feature selection, and machine learning model building.


##  Project Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand key features and trends.
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for optimal model performance.
- Visualize relationships between features and their impact on diabetes.
- Apply feature engineering and selection techniques.
- Train multiple machine learning classification models.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Identify the best-performing model for predicting diabetes.
